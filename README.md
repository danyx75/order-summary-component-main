### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 blue;
}

### Continued development

I'm planning on doing more projects from frontend mentor so I can get better at coding and whenever I come across to a problem I plan to look through the code to see where something is going wrong and find a solution to that problem.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me on how to use box shadow and gives you good example's on how to use it.
